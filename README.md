# Pre-work - TipCalculator

This is a Tip Calculator iOS application created as a submission piece for CodePath's iOS Bootcamp. It was fun (and frustrating) to create this app!

Submitted by: Derek Vallar

Time Spent: 20 hours

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:
* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [X] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [X] UI animations
* [X] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [X] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesnt have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:
* [X] Variable tip
* [X] Split tip/totals
* [X] Dark theme
